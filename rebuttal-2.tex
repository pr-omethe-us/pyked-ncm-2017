% The material below is a whole big dang thing whose purpose is just to set up a fixed coordinate system for \tikz so that you can put the Department or School address in the upper right-hand side without it moving all around every time you change something in the page.  I think it works.
% Defining a new coordinate system for the page:

% --------------------------
% |(-1,1)    (0,1)    (1,1)|
% |                        |
% |(-1,0)    (0,0)    (1,0)|
% |                        |
% |(-1,-1)   (0,-1)  (1,-1)|

% One can add a signature image in a PDF file using the following code; this requires a file called "signature_block.pdf" to be installed in the same folder as the .tex file.
% The vertical spacing (\vspace) and the scaling will have to be adjusted to get things to look correct for your particular signature image.
% Alternatively, comment out the following line in favor of the one labeled "[[Alternate]]" if you want to sign a paper copy of the letter.

% This block sets up the address on the right-hand side of the header.

% This line sets up the return address to the right-side of the OSU logo.  The location is set with absolute node addresses using ``\tikz''.  It can still be a bit fussy, and you may need to alter this a little to get things to look right.  The bit that changes the position are the numbers in parentheses ``at (14.2,2.7)''

We enclose revisions for our manuscript ``ChemKED: a human- and machine-readable
data standard for chemical kinetics experiments``
and address the reviewers' comments in the following remarks.
We have indicated our additions and deletions using \addone{teal text}
for Reviewer \#1 and \addtwo{red text} for Reviewer \#2.


{\bf Reviewer \#1}
\begin{quoting}
Page 5, line 36: The following information `os' required ...
\end{quoting}

We have corrected the text on page 5: ``The following information
\deleteone{os}~\addone{is} required in each element of the sequence:''

\vspace{2em}


{\bf Reviewer \#2}
\begin{quoting}
    The authors properly answered the questions and comments. I suggest the publication
    of the manuscript after further minor modifications.

    Minor comments:

    p. 2, last lines:
    Notes: (1) the specification is available without registration; (2) I do not think
    that the requirement of an institutional e-mail address prevents the access of the public.
    ORIGINAL:
    Moreover, the standard remains inaccessible to the public, requiring potential
    users to register with the standard's authors using a valid institutional email
    address to access the specification and the growing database. \\
    SUGGESTED:
    Moreover, the potential users are required to register using a valid institutional
    email address to access the growing database.
\end{quoting}



\begin{quoting}
    p. 3, first para:
    ORIGINAL:
    ... improved models for hydrogen/syngas [13], methanol/formaldehyde [14], and
    ethanol [15]. In all five cases, \\
    SUGGESTED:
    improved models for hydrogen [Proc. Combust. Inst.,  35, 589-596 (2015)],
    hydrogen/syngas [13], methanol/formaldehyde [14], and ethanol [15]. In all six cases,
\end{quoting}

We have adopted the suggested text on page 3:
``\ldots improved models for \addtwo{hydrogen [13]},
hydrogen\slash syngas [14], methanol\slash formaldehyde [15],
and ethanol [16]. In all \deletetwo{five}~\addtwo{six} cases \ldots''


\begin{quoting}
    p. 3, first para:
    ORIGINAL:
    contains 93,240 experimental data points in 1376 ReSpecTh XML files\\
    SUGGESTED:
    contains 93,326 data points in 1396 ReSpecTh XML files
\end{quoting}

We have adopted the suggested text on page 3:
``Their database currently contains \deletetwo{\num{93240}}~\addtwo{\num{93326}}
experimental data points in \deletetwo{1376}~\addtwo{1396}
ReSpecTh XML files [17].''

\begin{quoting}
    p. 7, last lines
    ``the 0-based index of the column'' (twice)
    I do not understand this term and maybe some other readers also will not.
\end{quoting}



\begin{quoting}
    ``A sequence of sequences describing the values''
    I do not understand this term and maybe some other readers also will not.
\end{quoting}



\begin{quoting}
    p. 9
    ``If the volume-history of an RCM experiment is provided in the
    ChemKED file, it is stored in this attribute as a namedtuple ,''
    Question: Is this format able to handle the case when a shock tube measurement
    is accompanied with a pressure history?
\end{quoting}



\begin{quoting}
    p. 10, first para:
    ORIGINAL:
    not all ReSpecTh files may be converted to ChemKED files
    SUGGESTED:
    not all ReSpecTh files may be equivalently converted to ChemKED files
\end{quoting}

We have adopted the suggested text on page 10:
``not all ReSpecTh files may be \addtwo{equivalently} converted to ChemKED files''.

\begin{quoting}
    Reference [21]:
    ``döt Net''   ???????
\end{quoting}

This is the correct surname for one of the creators of the YAML data format: Ingy döt Net.


%%%%%%% ``closing'' sets the sign-off line.
\closing{Sincerely,}

%\encl{If an enclosure is provided, let them know what it is.}
