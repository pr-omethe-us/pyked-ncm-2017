\begin{document}

We thank the reviewers for their helpful and detailed comments, and have addressed their remarks here.
The manuscript has been significantly revised, and we marked significant changes corresponding to suggestions from Reviewers \#1 and \#2 in \hlg{yellow} and \hly{green}, respectively.


\section*{Reviewer \#1:}

\begin{reviewer}
    %
    Currently four database formats are offered for storing combustion experimental data. These are
    CloudFlame (Excel/CSV format), PrIMe (XML-based format), ReSpecTh (also XML-based format), and
    ChemKED (YAML-based format). Elaboration of the last format is reported in the submitted
    manuscript. The motivation for the elaboration of this new format was based on the statement
    that YAML is more human readable than XML. I think that this is simply not true. Even a
    first-time user can read the raw datafiles of both formats with equal efficiency. Also,
    currently the suggested new format is much more limited (e.g. it is able to encode ignition
    delay time experiments only). The presently planned features of ChemKED are already available in
    the other three formats.

    However, I suggest the publication of an improved and shortened version of the manuscript in
    IJCK. The reason is that a permanent and laboratory-independent storage of experimental data is
    an important issue and I agree that a public discussion promotes the acceptance of a widely used
    common format.

    I think that the paper contains too much information science details. Still, as the authors
    note, the description is not comprehensive and they refer to the user manual. I suggest the
    creation of a significantly abridged version that contains the basic information technology
    points only and does not discuss the details. For example, Chapter 4 could be deleted and
    Chapters 2 and 3 may also be shortened.

    database files.''

    XML is a text format and it is fully human readable, similarly to YMAL. Even a
    first-time user is able to read the chemical content of a  PrIMe XML file and an experienced
    user is able to write such a file.

    technical changes due to the different computation background. Professor Frenklach plans to

\section*{Reviewer \#2:}

\begin{reviewer}
    %
    My main concern with the creation of a publically available database, formatted with ChemKED, is
    that it seems that the creation of the files has to be done manually, i.e. susceptible for
    errors. This is especially true if the experiment comprises a big set of datapoints and/or
    hundreds of measured species. Furthermore, the YAML data serialization format is indeed
    human-readable, but it does not provide an easy summary/overview of the experimental data, such
    as an excel or CSV file would give, and therefore, people might be not willing to put the extra
    effort.
    %
\end{reviewer}

\begin{reviewer}
    %
    1.~How are the authors planning on `forcing' the experimentalists to publish their data in this
    new ChemKED file format?
    %
\end{reviewer}

\begin{response}
    %
    While we cannot force anyone to use a particular format, we hope that by defining a format and
    ecosystem with desirable features---including inherent openness and usability---experimentalists
    will begin adopting a community-standard format. In fact, we have already received interest from
    various groups, and hope this will grow as we continue to improve and add features. We also hope
    that at a certain point, with wide adoption, sharing experimental data in a standard format will
    become the expected norm (e.g., when submitting an article for publication) like sharing a
    Chemkin-format chemical kinetic model.
    %
\end{response}

\begin{reviewer}
    %
    2.~Am I correct to state that ChemKED is a YAML file with a predefined structure?
    %
\end{reviewer}

\begin{response}
    %
    Yes, ChemKED files are files in YAML format, with a prescribed structure and set of contents.
    %
\end{response}

\begin{reviewer}

    3.~I think the article would be more appealing if it would have at least one figure as an
    example.

    %
    4. In the abstract, it is mentioned that the Python-based package PyKED creates ChemKED-
    formatted files. However in the article there is no evidence that PyKED aides in creating
    ChemKED-formatted files.

    however, this is not mentioned in section 5, Conclusions and future work, nor is there any

        6. I don't completely agree with the second part of the statement on page 2 line 16-18:
        ``Second, the XML format is intended to be a machine-readable mark-up language rather than a
        data format, and its lack of human readability presents a barrier to creating and working
        with database files.''

        In my opinion the YAML format resembles the XML format strongly. XML format is human-readable,
        however, because of the html-tags and `\texttt{<>} characters, the YAML format might be easier
        to read. If XML would lack human readability as it is stated in the article, it would not be
        such a popular format, and I don't think PrIMe and ReSpecTh would be using it.
    %
\end{reviewer}

\begin{response}
    %
    We agree with the reviewer that XML is technically human readable by an expert (as opposed to,
    say, a binary format), and also that YAML is easier to read---by ``human-readable'', we really
    mean human-\emph{understandable}.
    %
\end{response}

\begin{reviewer}
    %
    7.~An initial version of the ChemKED format was introduced by Niemeyer, as is mentioned in the
    introduction. The mentioned article describes a Python-package called PyTeCK. How does this
    PyTeCK package relate to the PyKED package that is presented in the submitted article?

\subsection*{Overview of ChemKED format}

\begin{reviewer}
    %
    9.~A reference should not be a required mapping of an experimental dataset. If the intention is
    to make the community to adopt the ChemKED file structure, it might be easier to do so if
    experimentalists can use the structure internally as well, i.e. to read, store, and share
    non-published internal data.

\end{response}

\begin{reviewer}
    %
    10.~Page 4, line 32: ``The second section of the file encodes the experimental data''. Perhaps
    it is easier to follow if this is briefly mentioned before the authors explain the details of
    the first section of the ChemKED format.

    11.~Why do both \texttt{atomic-composition} and \texttt{elemental-composition} exist as

    12.~Is it possible to create for example two \texttt{common-properties} \texttt{composition}
    blocks A and B and refer to them in the \texttt{DataPoint} keys?

\begin{reviewer}
    %
    13.~Page 6, line 12 describes the initial efforts of building an open repository of ChemKED
    files, on GitHub. Is this the most efficient way for making a publically available database? One
    issue with this is the fact that adding files is done via pull requests, which have to be
    verified and approved by the owners of the repository. Therefore a certain delay is inevitable.

    14.~Page 6, line 18 states that a converter exists from ReSpecTh to ChemKED. But isn't this
    feature added when going from v0.1.6 to v0.2.0, which makes page 3 line 21: v0.1.6 not correct.
